# Judging the certainty of evidence from a research study

### Description

Students will work in small groups (4 people) to judge the certainty of evidence from a research study (using an example article from the syllabus for that week). Students will provide a slide presentation with voiceover (10 minutes maximum, 8-10 slides). The list of topics and dates for group presentations will be posted the first week of class.

Presentations must be posted by noon EST on the Monday of your scheduled week:

- Week 4 RCT
- Week 5 Systematic review
- Week 6 Non-randomized study of interventions

**25% of final grade**

### Structure

The presentation should include a brief summary of the study approach (purpose, design, setting and sample, methods), presentation and interpretation of results, and of the certainty of evidence using the GRADE framework.
