### Description

Students will compile, review, critically appraise, and synthesize research evidence about a topic or question, and prepare a summary of findings using the GRADE approach. The topic/question should address a practice situation that calls for a specific strategy or direction (in other words - an intervention). The literature review must include 3 published research studies. You are welcome to use the PICO question and search results from the assignment in NUR1027 if you wish. You will provide a summary of the studies (key features of each study, substantive results) and a summary of your critical appraisal, using the GRADE approach in the body of the paper. As such, you need to address the key elements of <a href="https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/">GRADE</a>, being risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency and the completeness of reporting of research. The assignment will conclude with overall conclusions regarding the state of the evidence, and a GRADE recommendation to address the practice issue or situation.
