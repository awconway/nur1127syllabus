## Discussion group

Participation in an asynchronous discussion group, found by clicking on "Discussions" in Quercus will give you an opportunity for further clarification and commentary on the key concepts and learning activities, through dialogue with your classmates, professor and teaching assistant. It is expected that students will regularly respond to questions and comments posed on the discussion board, and that posts will develop increasing depth and sophistication as the course progresses.



## Online activities

In addition to independent learning activities, there will be regular online group activities designed to create learning synergies, extend your critical thinking about the course material, and build a sense of community among students.



## Working in an online environment

How do I work and learn in an online environment?
The online environment provides increased flexibility in terms of when and where you engage in learning activities. However it can also present challenges, requiring a degree of self-discipline to ensure you are able to take advantage of group discussions and learn from the observations and insights of your colleagues, as well as the course faculty. Here are some tips to help you be successful in engaging in on-line learning:

- This is a relatively self-directed learning environment, so it is important to manage your time carefully.
- As is the case in all graduate programs (both in-class and on-line), the course requires a considerable amount of independent study, guided by the resources and learning activities provided each week. Be sure to complete the weekly learning activities, and to participate in the Discussion every week. This is where we will work through together any questions you have about the material you are studying.
- Organize your time to ensure that you can complete the weekly reading and other learning activities on time. It is critical that you do not get behind.
- While completing the weekly learning activities, compile a list of questions or concerns that arise so that you can seek help via your colleagues on the discussion board.
