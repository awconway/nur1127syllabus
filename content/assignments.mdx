## Appearance and editing of assignments

All written assignments should be carefully proofread and well edited. The required style manual for the formatting of essays and assignments at the Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing is that of the American Psychological Association (APA) 7th edition, which is described in:

_Publications Manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.). Washington: American Psychological Association, 2010._

The Purdue Online Writing Lab provides a helpful overview of the <a target="_blank" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/">General APA guidelines</a>.

## Submission

When submitting your assignment electronically, please name the file as follows: surname_first

written assignment, name the file jones_m_assignment1.docx.

## Cover page

Each paper should be presented with a formal cover page, which includes:

1. A title for the paper (Select a title that describes the substantive focus of the
   assignment). Please do not name your papers “Assignment 1,” “Search Assignment”,
   etc.)
1. Course number and title
1. Professor’s name
1. Student’s name (or initials, if you prefer) and student number

## References and appendices

Include a reference list of cited material using APA (7th edition) referencing format. For assignments that require Appendices, place these after the reference list.
