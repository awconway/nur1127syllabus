## Course drop date

Sunday, February 20, 2022 is the final date to drop Winter 2022 session courses without academic penalties. For sessional dates for 2021-22 visit: https://bloomberg.nursing.utoronto.ca/current-students/sessional-dates-and-calendar#content2.


## Grading of Written Assignments

All written assignments are subject to the grading regulations as outlined in the Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing calendar and the School of Graduate Studies Calendar.

Late assignments after the due date will accrue a late penalty of 5% each day (including weekends).

## Submission of Assignments


For Online Courses: 

On the due date, please submit an electronic copy of your paper/assignment to the digital drop box linked to Ouriginal through Quercus. Your paper/assignment will NOT be evaluated until it is submitted to Ouriginal using Quercus. 



## Writing an exam out of sequence or receiving an extension on an assignment

In an exceptional circumstance, e.g. death in family or medical illness, a student may be allowed to write an exam out of sequence or receive an extension on an assignment.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, U of T is temporarily suspending the need for a doctor’s note or medical certificate for any absence from academic participation in the University. All students have been instructed to self-report flu-like or cold symptoms **as well as any other health related absence** via ACORN in lieu of a note from a licensed health care provider. **Students still need to contact the instructor as soon as possible prior to the exam/assignment deadline to discuss the concern with the exam date or assignment deadline.** Please allow for leeway in these extraordinary times and reach out if you have additional questions. If a makeup sitting for an exam or an assignment deadline extension is granted, an alternate date needs to be set as close to the date of the original exam/assignment due date as possible. In case of an exam, you will be asked to complete the Declaration of Confidentiality for Students Sitting Tests/Examinations at Other Than the Regular Specified Time.

## Questions About Assignment

In the interest of fairness and transparency, please direct your questions about the paper to the proper discussion board on Quercus. If you do send an email to the instructor or teaching assistant, you may be encouraged to share this answer on the discussion board if the information is helpful to other learners in the course. Students are not permitted to submit a detailed, formal outline of the assignment for evaluation or instructor/TA feedback before the due date. As always, the instructor and/or TA would be happy to answer your questions via Quercus, email, telephone, or in person.

## Plagiarism & Academic Integrity

Ouriginal is used in this course. Normally, students will be required to submit their course assignments to the University’s plagiarism detection tool (Ouriginal) for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their assignments to be included as source documents in the tool’s (Ouriginal) reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University's use of the Ouriginal service are described on the Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation website (https://uoft.me/pdt-faq). 

Students do have the option of handing in all their rough drafts and notes of their paper/assignment if they are opposed to using Ouriginal. These students must approach their faculty teacher(s) in advance. 

Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the University of Toronto is a strong reflection of each student’s individual academic achievement.

The University of Toronto Governing Council Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters
(University of Toronto Governing Council, 2019) is found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.governingcouncil.lamp4.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/p0701coboam-2015-2016pol.pdf">here</a>. The code outlines offences that constitute academic misconduct and processes for addressing academic offences. Section B.1 of the code (copied below) outlines academic offences.

It shall be an offence for a student knowingly:

(a) to forge or in any other way alter or falsify any document or evidence required by the University, or to utter, circulate or make use of any such forged, altered or falsified document, whether the record be in print or electronic form;
(b) to use or possess an unauthorized aid or aids or obtain unauthorized assistance in any academic examination or term test or in connection with any other form of academic work;
(c) to personate another person, or to have another person personate, at any academic examination or term test or in connection with any other form of academic work;
(d) to represent as one’s own any idea or expression of an idea or work of another in any academic examination or term test or in connection with any other form of academic work, i.e. to commit plagiarism (for a more detailed account of plagiarism, see Appendix "A") ;
(e) to submit, without the knowledge and approval of the instructor to whom it is submitted, any academic work for which credit has previously been obtained or is being sought in another course or program of study in the University or elsewhere;
(f) to submit any academic work containing a purported statement of fact or reference to a source which has been concocted. (Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 2019)

All suspected incidents of academic misconduct will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters (University of Toronto Governing Council, 2019).

## ProctorU Live+

Online exam(s) within this course [may] use online invigilation provided by ProctorU®, a live online proctoring service that allows completion of the assessment from an off-campus location. A highly trained human proctor will observe your completion of the exam using specialized software. Recordings will be made and held for a limited period of time in order to ensure academic integrity is maintained. The University of Toronto has an institutionally endorsed agreement with ProctorU that protects the privacy of the recordings, and other personal information.

Requirements: Students taking their examinations online will be proctored by ProctorU® throughout the duration of the exam. Access to a computer that can support remote recording is your responsibility as a student. You will need to ensure that you can complete the exam using a reliable computer with a webcam and microphone available, as well as a high-speed internet connection. Please note that you will be required to show your T-Card prior to beginning to write the exam. 

Detailed information and an opportunity to test your setup will be provided prior to the exam date. For additional information about online proctoring please see course information in Quercus, or visit UofT Online Proctoring Guidelines at https://teaching.utoronto.ca/ed-tech/online-learning/online-proctoring/ 

General Description for Using ProctorU Live+:  Students must first confirm their identity with photo ID with the human proctor. The proctor then closely monitors students and their immediate environment throughout the entire exam using webcams and remote desktop monitoring through high-speed Internet connections. All components of proctoring must be maintained for the duration of the exam. During the exam, the proctor may reach out to the student if they lose the ability to proctor the exam (camera view obstructed/loss of remote desktop view). If the proctor contacts the student during the exam through a pop-up message, voice, or a loud beep, the student is required to respond to the proctor. Failure to respond to the proctor to allow proctoring threatens the integrity of the exam. Non-compliance with exam protocols flagged by the invigilator will be investigated to determine whether an academic offence has been committed as per the University of Toronto Governing Council Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. At the completion of the exam, a report of student exam-taking behaviours is generated and reviewed by the course instructor(s) and our IT staff. Exam grades will not be released to students until the integrity of the exam has been verified through ProctorU®, the course instructor(s), and our IT staff. 

Privacy and Information Security: The University of Toronto has a contract with ProctorU® that protects the privacy of the recordings, and other personal information. As you will be video recorded while writing the exam, you may want to consider preparing the background (room / walls) so that personal details you would not want visible are removed or take your exam in a room that you are comfortable showing on camera. It is recommended that students using ProctorU services remove the Chrome or Firefox extension after completion of the exam.

Retention of Video Content: Recordings captured via the ProctorU® system are available to the University and the instructor for one year after a recording is made. After this period of time has passed, recordings are purged.

For more information see ProctorU: Privacy and Security Information Notice for Students please see the following https://teaching.utoronto.ca/ed-tech/online-learning/online-proctoring/proctoru-privacy/

The Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing participates in the University of Toronto’s centralized ‘Student Evaluation of Courses’ system. Towards the end of this course, you will receive an email inviting you to complete an online evaluation of this course. The email will provide you with the specific information and links needed to access and complete course evaluation. Your ratings and comments will be anonymous but will be aggregated for summary across evaluations. Once a process has been established, summarized course evaluations will be made available within the faculty and university community.
