## Course drop date

March 1st, 2021 is the final date to drop Winter 2021 session courses without academic penalties. Click [here](https://bloomberg.nursing.utoronto.ca/current-students/sessional-dates-and-calendar#content2) for drop dates for 2020-21 courses.


## Grading of Written Assignments

All written assignments are subject to the grading regulations as outlined in the Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing calendar and the School of Graduate Studies Calendar.

Late assignments after the due date will accrue a late penalty of 5% each day (including weekends).

## Submission of Assignments


For Online Courses: 

On the due date, please submit an electronic copy of your paper/assignment to the digital drop box in Turnitin using Quercus.  Your paper/assignment will NOT be evaluated until it is submitted to Turnitin using Quercus. 



## Writing an exam out of sequence or receiving an extension on an assignment

In an exceptional circumstance, e.g. death in family or medical illness, a student may be allowed to write an exam out of sequence or receive an extension on an assignment.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, U of T is temporarily suspending the need for a doctor’s note or medical certificate for any absence from academic participation in the University. All students have been instructed to self-report flu-like or cold symptoms **as well as any other health related absence** via ACORN in lieu of a note from a licensed health care provider. **Students still need to contact the instructor as soon as possible prior to the exam/assignment deadline to discuss the concern with the exam date or assignment deadline.** Please allow for leeway in these extraordinary times and reach out if you have additional questions. If a makeup sitting for an exam or an assignment deadline extension is granted, an alternate date needs to be set as close to the date of the original exam/assignment due date as possible. In case of an exam, you will be asked to complete the Declaration of Confidentiality for Students Sitting Tests/Examinations at Other Than the Regular Specified Time.

## Questions About Assignment

In the interest of fairness and transparency, please direct your questions about the paper to the proper discussion board on Quercus. If you do send an email to the instructor or teaching assistant, you may be encouraged to share this answer on the discussion board if the information is helpful to other learners in the course. Students are not permitted to submit a detailed, formal outline of the assignment for evaluation or instructor/TA feedback before the due date. As always, the instructor and/or TA would be happy to answer your questions via Quercus, email, telephone, or in person.

## Plagiarism & Academic Integrity

Turnitin is used in this course. Normally, students will be required to submit their course assignments to Turnitin.com for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their assignments to be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University's use of the Turnitin.com service are described on the Turnitin.com web site. Students do have the option of handing in all their rough drafts and notes of their paper if they are opposed using to Turnitin. These students must approach their faculty teacher(s) in advance.

Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the University of Toronto is a strong reflection of each student’s individual academic achievement.

The University of Toronto Governing Council Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters
(University of Toronto Governing Council, 2019) is found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.governingcouncil.lamp4.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/p0701coboam-2015-2016pol.pdf">here</a>. The code outlines offences that constitute academic misconduct and processes for addressing academic offences. Section B.1 of the code (copied below) outlines academic offences.

It shall be an offence for a student knowingly:

(a) to forge or in any other way alter or falsify any document or evidence required by the University, or to utter, circulate or make use of any such forged, altered or falsified document, whether the record be in print or electronic form;
(b) to use or possess an unauthorized aid or aids or obtain unauthorized assistance in any academic examination or term test or in connection with any other form of academic work;
(c) to personate another person, or to have another person personate, at any academic examination or term test or in connection with any other form of academic work;
(d) to represent as one’s own any idea or expression of an idea or work of another in any academic examination or term test or in connection with any other form of academic work, i.e. to commit plagiarism (for a more detailed account of plagiarism, see Appendix "A") ;
(e) to submit, without the knowledge and approval of the instructor to whom it is submitted, any academic work for which credit has previously been obtained or is being sought in another course or program of study in the University or elsewhere;
(f) to submit any academic work containing a purported statement of fact or reference to a source which has been concocted. (Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 2019)

All suspected incidents of academic misconduct will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters (University of Toronto Governing Council, 2019).

## ProctorU

The University of Toronto Master of Nursing NP Field, Health System Leadership and Administration Field, and Post-Master of Nursing Nurse Practitioner Diploma programs offer students the opportunity to take exams at home with online proctoring. In such cases, the Faculty uses online proctoring services to ensure exam integrity. The Faculty of Nursing contracts with an organization called ProctorU to complete online proctoring for students taking examinations online. Students who take their examinations online must agree to be proctored by ProctorU throughout the duration of the exam. ProctorU provides live proctoring by highly-trained human proctors.

Students must first confirm their identity with photo ID with the human proctor. The proctor then closely monitors students throughout the entire exam using webcams and remote desktop monitoring through high-speed Internet connections. All components of proctoring must be maintained for the duration of the exam. During the exam, the proctor may reach out to the student if they lose the ability to proctor the exam (camera view obstructed/loss of remote desktop view). If the proctor contacts the student during the exam through a pop-up message, voice, or a loud beep, the student is expected to respond to the proctor. **Failure to respond to the proctor to allow proctoring threatens the integrity of the exam.** This will be investigated to determine whether an academic offence has been committed as per the University of Toronto Governing Council Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. Students who do not agree to be proctored by ProctorU must take their examination on campus at the University of Toronto or at an approved Exam Testing Centre (at the expense of the student) at the same time as the exam is offered online. In such cases, students must notify the Faculty at least two weeks in advance so that appropriate arrangements can be made.

At the completion of the exam, a report of student exam-taking behaviours is generated and reviewed by Faculty and IT staff. Exam grades will NOT be released to students until the integrity of the exam has been verified through ProctorU, the Faculty of Nursing IT staff, and relevant teaching Faculty.

## Accessibility Statement

## Student Evaluation of Courses

Student evaluation of courses is an essential component of our educational programs at the Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing. Student feedback enables us to continue to improve our teaching effectiveness to enhance student learning.

The Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing participates in the University of Toronto’s centralized ‘Student Evaluation of Courses’ system. Towards the end of this course, you will receive an email inviting you to complete an online evaluation of this course. The email will provide you with the specific information and links needed to access and complete course evaluation. Your ratings and comments will be anonymous but will be aggregated for summary across evaluations. Once a process has been established, summarized course evaluations will be made available within the faculty and university community. For more information about the University of Toronto policy about student evaluation of courses, please refer to the
